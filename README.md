# About this repository

This is just a space in which I'm casually familiarizing myself with text-mining via NLTK.

# Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtual environment (e.g. via `python -m venv env`)
3. Activate your virtual environment
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run `get_dependencies.py`
6. Run `app.py` to see current functionality

# Project structure

`src` holds all code.
`app.py` is the program.
`texts.py` just holds some example texts.

# Cross platform compatibility

Tested on Windows only. Make sure to remove `os.system('cls')` if you encounter it while working on a linux/iOS machine.
